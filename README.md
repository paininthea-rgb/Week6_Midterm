# Week6_Midterm

Renting house vs Buying house

Fewer (if any) maintenance costs
No down payment required (less deposit)
No real estate taxes (renters insurance optional)
Less stress (who cares, it’s not yours!)
Freedom to move or downsize when necessary
No risk of home price depreciation
Some utility bills may be included
“Free” amenities such as pool, gym, security
Money can be used for other, more profitable investments
Can’t be foreclosed on
