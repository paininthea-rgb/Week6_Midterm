![Renting house vs buying house](house.jpg "Mid term argument")

This is about renting a house vs buying a house.

## Section 1: Aguring for renting a house

Buying house is investment

No, it isn’t. Investment pays dividends. Your house pays nothing, it only costs you money. It is not investment, it is speculation. You are hoping to sell it to a bigger fool for bigger money sometimes later. You also pay taxes on it every year. I don’t need to pay taxes on stocks I own, until I sell it or until they pay dividends.
